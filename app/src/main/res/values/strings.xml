    <string name="about_message">This application contains a home page with its title, a navigation
    button, a field where text can be entered along with a send button, and four icons in a grid view.
    If a user enters text into the text field, then hits send, a secondary activity will be displayed
    where the text which was entered is shown. If the user clicks on the top left grid view icon, they
    will be taken to a RecyclerView list of different zombie movies, which can be clicked on to learn
    further information about which ever movie. Thanks for checking it out!</string>
